The Python module `mac.py` is a wrapper to `MAMS`'s serial API. Examples on how to use `mac.py` are provided in `demo.py`, which can be run via

```bash
python py/demo.py <SERIAL_PORT>
```
where `<SERIAL_PORT>` is the USB port name connected to MicroAlign device (e.g. `COM...` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSB...` on Linux, `/dev/cu.usbserial-...` on MacOS)
